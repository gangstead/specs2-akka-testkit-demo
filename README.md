specs2-akka-testkit-demo
========================

# Intro
This is a dead simple demo to test Actors with [specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) with Akka [TestKit](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/testing.html).  The code is modified from the demo code at http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/testing.html#Asynchronous_Integration_Testing_with_TestKit, which is for [scalatest](http://www.scalatest.org/).

The end result is very simple but I had to take the code apart and put it back together again to understand it.

# Running
```bash
> sbt test
```
